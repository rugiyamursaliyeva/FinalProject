## About the Project

This project is a **Code Academy platform** where users can explore courses, lessons, and detailed course information.  

There are **two types of users**:

- **Teachers**: Can create assignments, review submissions, and grade students.  
- **Students**: Can view course materials, complete assignments, and submit their work.  

The platform also has a **restricted login area** where only registered teachers and students can access their respective dashboards.  

This project demonstrates user roles, course management, and assignment handling in a simple educational platform.
